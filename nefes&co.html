                <h1>Nefes & Co</h1>
                <p>The NEFES project initially began as a comprehensive wellness application encompassing both pilates and meal planning.
                   However, through a series of iterative processes and user testing, 
                   it became evident that users had a stronger preference for meal planning over pilates. 
                   This revelation led to a significant pivot in our project direction. Guided by the core principle of "always user first" in UX design, 
                   we recognised the paramount importance of meeting users' needs. Consequently, we took a step back, reevaluated our approach, 
                   and set out to craft a more satisfying and user-centric outcome for our users!</p>

                <p>Allow health-conscious individuals to log in to a responsive health and wellbeing portal to record their health and medical information, 
                and access general physical and mental wellbeing features.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Wellness apps, while popular for their potential health benefits, exhibit several shortcomings that hinder their universal accessibility and effectiveness. 
                            These issues include limited personalisation, digital accessibility barriers, inadequate diversity representation, data privacy concerns, challenges with user engagement and adherence, cost-related barriers, an excessive focus on aesthetics, 
                            and the absence of mental health support. 
                            Additionally, the overreliance on these apps may overlook the importance of professional guidance and expertise. 
                            In sum, wellness apps often fall short in catering to the diverse needs and challenges faced by individuals.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="container">
                    <h1>Solution</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many wellness apps often overlook critical aspects, such as personalisation and user engagement.
                            For instance, some lack the ability to tailor recommendations to individual health goals or do not effectively motivate users to stay committed to their wellness journey. 
                            This gap in the market is why we developed Nefes, a mobile-first design that squarely addresses these issues. Nefes empowers users by providing personalised guidance while also allowing them to remain informed and in control of their progress.
                            With Nefes, users can take control of their well-being journey with unparalleled precision and convenience.

                <h1>Findings</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users would welcome this approach because it signifies that the app is designed with their unique needs and preferences in mind. 
                        They would appreciate having the ability to customise their wellness journey, 
                        receiving recommendations and content tailored specifically to their health goals and preferences.</li>
                    <li>Personal touch makes users feel valued and understood, fostering a stronger connection with the app.</li>
                    <li>Users striving to meet specific dietary goals, like weight loss or muscle gain, 
                        would welcome personalised meal plans that consider their dietary restrictions, 
                        culinary preferences, and past success with certain eating habits.</li>

            <h1>User Personas</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>To ensure our users remained central to our design process, 
                    we crafted two personas by consolidating insights gathered from interviews and surveys. 
                    These personas included crucial aspects such as demographics, goals, needs, frustrations, device and internet usage, and motivations.
                    This strategic approach enabled us to maintain a clear and concise reference point for our users' requirements throughout the project,
                     keeping their needs at the forefront of our design decisions.
                 </li>

        <div class="contrainer"
        <h1>User Journey</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Our next step was to develop user journey maps to streamline the organisation of the app. 
                Before embarking on the user journey process, we needed to define and understand the emotional aspects associated with various tasks and components.
                This allowed us to conduct a comprehensive analysis of our users, considering their feelings and experiences when engaging in activities like research,
                 account creation, goal setting, and setting daily reminders.
                Crafting user journeys enabled us to immerse ourselves in the users' perspective, 
                empathising with their emotions and thoughts. This approach empowers us to proactively anticipate their feelings and, 
                in turn, design a more intuitive and user-centric experience.

    <h1>User Flow</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>We developed user flows to understand the users' journey, anticipate their emotions, and create a more intuitive experience.
            This approach ensures clarity, user-centric design, and early identification of pain points. 
            It aligns the design with our app's goals and serves as a basis for user testing, ultimately leading to a more user-friendly product.

<h1>Ideate</h1>
<ul>
    <li> I wanted a tool that allowed participants to drag and drop cards, create and modify sets, and analyse data effectively,
         due to this I used suggested platform ' OW'. This way I gathered a set of digital cards representing the sitemap headings that I made. 
         Each card had a short title to show a specific piece of content.

         Looking at the standardisation grid, the card sorting for the headings are quite consistent and each participant has given similar responses. However, different responses were given for 'information' and 'login' headings which may be a result of confusion for participants .
        Taking this into consideration, some pages have been rearranged and renamed to avoid confusion.

<h1>Prototype</h1>
<ul>
    <li> Low fidelity wireframes: Low-fidelity wireframes played a pivotal role in rapidly generating ideas,
         enabling me to explore numerous concepts within a brief timeframe and filter out the most promising ones efficiently.</li>

         <img src="img/lowfid.png" alt="Low fidelity style="text-align: center;"> <!-- Align image to center -->

    <li>Mid fidelity wireframes: Upon reaching a satisfactory stage with my low-fidelity designs, 
        I proceeded to translate these concepts into digital design format.</li>
        <img src="img/midfid.png" alt="Mid fidelity style="text-align: center;"> <!-- Align image to center -->

    <li>High fidelity wireframes: This progression illustrates the journey from low-fidelity to mid-fidelity, 
        culminating in high-fidelity designs. As more tests are conducted, we witness the evolution of the design, 
        highlighting that UX design thrives on continuous improvement, iteration, and adaptation.</li>

<h1>User Testing</h1>
<ul>
    <li> I conducted six moderated-remote usability tests and systematically organised user feedback into categories comprising
         Observations, Negative and Positive Quotes, as well as identified Errors and corresponding Solutions. </li>
    <li>Goal: This study aims to evaluate the ease of learning for new users engaging with our wellness mobile application for the first time. 
        We intend to observe and assess users' comprehension of the app's purpose, its utility, and their ability to perform fundamental initial actions.</li>
    <li>At this stage, the project underwent a significant transformation, 
        narrowing its focus to become exclusively a meal-preparation app. This shift was driven by the findings from usability testing and subsequent results. 
        To further inform our approach, we conducted a thorough competitive analysis within the realm of meal planning applications.
         This was then followed by follow up emails and surveys.</li>

    <h1>A/B Preference Testing</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I executed preference testing using the Usability Hub platform, wherein I presented two versions of both the Login Screen
             and Meal Screen.
             The primary goal was to evaluate not just user preferences but also their envisioned design concept for a meal app.
             One design theme embraced a minimalist, blue aesthetic, while the alternative integrated a more extensive palette of colors, 
             images, and charts.

    <h1>Keeping Track!</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Upon logging in, users access a streamlined dashboard in our app, allowing them to track meal prep and progress efficiently.
             This saves time, motivates users, and enhances their overall experience.
             Additionally, we provide a separate section for users to monitor measurements like weight and calorie intake. This promotes health awareness, goal alignment, 
             and accountability, helping users make informed decisions and achieve their desired outcomes.

    <h1>Rewards</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>At Nefes, we empathise with the financial challenges that users may face while shopping in today's economy. 
            To alleviate this concern and foster user motivation, we've implemented a unique points system. 
            For every meals users prepare, they earn points that can be converted into real money. 
            This innovative approach is designed to reduce financial stress during shopping.
            Users have the flexibility to choose how they use their points. 
            They can either scan barcodes while shopping to redeem points immediately or save them for future use, 
            offering a practical and user-centric solution to financial constraints.

    <h1>And we have it! The final design!</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Reflecting on my very first case study, I can't help but feel a sense of pride. 
            While it had its share of challenges, the ultimate outcome leaves me with a profound sense of accomplishment. 
            So, congratulations to me!
            Throughout this journey, I learned the importance of prioritising the user's perspective. 
            It was a principle I held dear and consistently applied in every step of my design process. 
            Empathising with users' needs and pain points became not just a practice but a guiding light.
             I am committed to keeping this approach at the forefront of my design work, 
             knowing that it's the key to creating meaningful and user-centric experiences.
