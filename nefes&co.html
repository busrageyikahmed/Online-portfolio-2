            <h1>Nefes & Co </h1>
            <p>The NEFES project initially began as a comprehensive wellness application encompassing both pilates and meal planning.
               However, through a series of iterative processes and user testing, 
               it became evident that users had a stronger preference for meal planning over pilates. 
               This revelation led to a significant pivot in our project direction. Guided by the core principle of "always user first" in UX design, 
               we recognised the paramount importance of meeting users' needs. Consequently, we took a step back, reevaluated our approach, 
               and set out to craft a more satisfying and user-centric outcome for our users!</p>

                    <h1>Problem</h1>
                    <ul>Wellness apps, while popular for their potential health benefits, exhibit several shortcomings that hinder their universal accessibility and effectiveness. 
                        These issues include limited personalisation, digital accessibility barriers, inadequate diversity representation, data privacy concerns, challenges with user engagement and adherence, cost-related barriers, an excessive focus on aesthetics, 
                        and the absence of mental health support. 
                        Additionally, the overreliance on these apps may overlook the importance of professional guidance and expertise. 
                        In sum, wellness apps often fall short in catering to the diverse needs and challenges faced by individuals.

                    <h1>Solution</h1>
                    <ul>Many wellness apps often overlook critical aspects, such as personalisation and user engagement.
                        For instance, some lack the ability to tailor recommendations to individual health goals or do not effectively motivate users to stay committed to their wellness journey. 
                        This gap in the market is why we developed Nefes, a mobile-first design that squarely addresses these issues. Nefes empowers users by providing personalised guidance while also allowing them to remain informed and in control of their progress.
                         With Nefes, users can take control of their well-being journey with unparalleled precision and convenience.
